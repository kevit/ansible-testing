# What usually I test
 

## System Tests
To guarantee that the total build fulfills the business specifications.

 
### Acceptance testing:  
to verify if requirement meets (SLO, Security, NFR)

 
### Integration Tests
To guarantee that joined units inside system can act together without problems.

---

### Interoperability Testing
To make sure whether the system can operate well with third-party products or not

 

### Regression Testing
To make sure the systemâ€™s stability as it passes through an integration or maintenance


### Compatibility testing  
to ensure that the system is (still) compatible

---


## Ad-Hoc
you can try it right now

 
```sh

ansible all -m ping -i inventory.ini
ansible server01 -i inventory.ini -a "date"

```

winrm                          Run tasks over Microsoft's WinRM

```

---

## Playbooks: organize an actions as a runbook

```yaml

- name: Check if Rhein today is not deep enough
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Receive information
      ansible.builtin.set_fact:
        rhein_level: {{ lookup('url', 'https://api/level' }}
    - name: Check level
      assert:
        that:
          - rhein_level <= 60
        fail_msg: "Water level is too low"   

- name: Collect info
  hosts: web
  tasks:
   - name: Collect facts about distro
     setup: 
       filter:
         - 'ansible_distribution'
```

---

![bg right 100%](images/ansible_architecture.jpg)

## Callbacks: change output

or produce machine readable output

```shell

ANSIBLE_NOCOLOR
ANSIBLE_CALLBACK_WHITELIST=json
ANSIBLE_STDOUT_CALLBACK=json,selective

```
example of community.general.selective
```yaml
- ansible.builtin.debug:
    msg: "This will not be printed"

- ansible.builtin.debug:
    msg: "But this will"
  tags: [print_action]

```

## Run your tasks in context

```yaml
## Here you setup scope
- hosts: webservers

## Here you can setup context
## Run VM, set downtimes

  pre_tasks:

    - name: take out of load balancer pool
      command: /usr/bin/take_out_of_pool {{ inventory_hostname }}
      ## Here you can delegate jobs somewhere
      delegate_to: 127.0.0.1

    - name: Create a downtime
      register: downtime_var
      community.general.datadog_downtime:
        state: present
        monitor_tags:
            - "balancer:tier3"
        downtime_message: "Downtime for balancer:tier3"
        scope: "test"
        ## will throw if downtime not created
        id: "{{ lookup('file', inventory_hostname ~ '_downtime_id.txt', errors='ignore') }}" 

```


---
 

```yaml

  ## Here goes main block
  tasks:
    ## You can execute tasks by blocks
    - name: Unsolicited upgrade
      block:
    ## Scripts are in /files directory, if exit non zero task failed
        - script: script --server {{ inventory_hostname }}
          delegate_to: testing_server
      rescue:
    ## Block run ALWAYS if something went wrong
        - name: Send notify to Telegram
          community.general.telegram:
            token: "{{telegram_token}}"
            api_args:
              chat_id: "{{telegram_chat_id}}"
              parse_mode: "markdown"
              text: |
                "Ansible task failed"
                ## Test
              disable_web_page_preview: true
              disable_notification: false
      always:
      # The always section runs regardless of the results of the block and rescue sections.

```

---

 

```yaml
  ## post tasks will be executed if tasks (and pre_tasks) been successuly done
  post_tasks:
    - name: add back to load balancer pool
      command: /usr/bin/add_back_to_pool {{ inventory_hostname }}
      delegate_to: 127.0.0.1
    - name: Send notify to Telegram
      community.general.telegram:
        token: "{{telegram_token}}"
        api_args:
          chat_id: "{{telegram_chat_id}}"
          parse_mode: "markdown"
          text: |
              "Ansible task surprisingly went well"
          disable_web_page_preview: true
          disable_notification: false
```

---

 

## Fail smart way

## Using fail statement

```yaml

    - action: uri url=https://google.com return_content=yes
      register: webpage


    - debug:
        msg: "{{ webpage.content }}"

    - fail:
        msg: 'google is not responding'
      when: "'DOCTYPE' not in webpage.content"

```

---

 

## Using asserts

```yaml
- hosts: localhost
  vars:
    fruits:
      - oranges
      - lemons

  tasks:
    - assert:
        that: >-
                    'apples' in fruits
        msg: you have no apples

    - assert:
        that: >-
                    'lemons' in fruits
        msg: you have no lemons

```


---

 
## Give computers a time, they are slow! 

```yaml
- name: check for proper response
  uri:
    url: http://localhost/app
    return_content: yes
  register: result

  until: '"Hello World" in result.content'
  retries: 10
  delay: 1

```

 
---


## This is fine!


The max_fail_percentage setting applies to each batch when you use it with serial.

In the example above, if more than 4 of the 10 servers in any batch of servers failed, the rest of the play would be aborted.

```yaml
- hosts: web
  serial: 10
  max_fail_percentage: 40
  tasks:
    - local_action: command smoke/test.py "{{ansible_host}}"
      changed_when: False

```

 

---

## Smoke tests

Advantage: single test check them all
Disadvantage: When it fails, you don't know which component to blame

 
```yaml
- name: Confirm that 200 OK response is returned
  uri:
    url: http://{{ ansible_host }}/api/v1/healthcheck
    status_code: 200
```
 

---

 

## You can adapt your test depends of the test reason  

 

## Interoperability

```yaml
    - name: "Check if port is opened"
      ansible.builtin.wait_for:
        port: 80
        state: "started"
        timeout: 300

    - name: "Check Content"
      ansible.builtin.assert:
        that: "'My webservice' is in r_working.content"
```

---

 

## Acceptance or security

```yaml
    - name: "Check if port is closed"
      ansible.builtin.wait_for:
        port: 25
        state: "stopped"
        timeout: 300

    - name: Check API version after updates
      uri:
        url: http://{{ ansible_host }}/api/v1/appVersion
        register: updated_api_version_result
      failed_when: updated_api_version_result['json']['appVersion'] != desired_app_version

```

---

 

## How you can organize and reuse your code

```yaml

- name:  "Notify the firewall smoke tests"
  debug:
    msg: "Trigger smoke tests"
  notify: "smoke"
  changed_when: true

```

---

```yaml

handlers:
        - name: local machine can reach web ports
          wait_for:
            host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
            port: "{{ item }}"
            timeout: 5
            state: started

          delegate_to: 127.0.0.1
          become: no
          with_items:
            - [80, 443]
          listen: "smoke"

        - name: "Get homepages"
          environment:
            no_proxy: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
          uri:
            url: https://{{ inventory_hostname }}/
            return_content: yes
            follow_redirects: all
            status_code: 200
            validate_certs: no
          register: homepage
          listen: "smoke"
```
 ---

```yaml
        - name: "Ensure that the homepage serves real content"
          assert:
            that:
              - "'My Home Page' in homepage.content"
              - "{{ application_version }}" in homepage.content
          listen: "smoke"

```

---

 

## Collect info by Ansible

 

## Setup 

```yaml

- hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
    - name: collect facts
      setup:
        gather_subset: ['env','!all','!min']

```

you can create custom facts anyway or run external collectors

 

---


## Guardrails
Garbage in -- Garbage out, use filters

```yaml

  vars:
    hostname_pattern=^i-*$

- name: fail if this is a bad host
  fail:
    msg: This is a bad host
  when: not inventory_hostname | match (hostname_pattern)

## Be sure that you checks for DB in DB scope!
```yaml
- name: {{inventory_hostname} refers to a databases
  assert:
    that:
      - {{inventory_hostname}} in groups['databases']
```

---

## Check vars in different scopes
```yaml
hostvars['your_host_group'].ansible_host
hostvars['inventory_hostname'].ansible_host
```

## Check facts or vars by patterns
```yaml
- name: usernames match pattern
  assert:
    that:
    # must match NAME_REGEX
    - user | match("[a-z][-a-z0-9]*")
  with_dict: "{{ web_users }}"

```



---

 ## Multistage web interfaces
 ```yaml
  - name: Step 5 General Set-up
    uri:
      url: "https://{{ inventory_hostname }}/index.php?action=setupSuperUser&module=Installation&clientProtocol=https"
      body:

      body_format: form-urlencoded
      method: POST
      status_code: 302
      validate_certs: no
      headers:
        Cookie: "{{ session.cookies_string }}"
```

--- 

```yaml
